    "- How an agent reasons using the **Thought–Action–Observation** loop.  \n",
    "- How to integrate **tools** like a calculator or Wikipedia search.  \n",
    "- How to **extend** the system with your own creative ideas.  \n",

    "💬 **Next steps**\n",
    "- Try connecting to real APIs (e.g., OpenWeather, NewsAPI).  \n",
    "- Build a more advanced multi-tool agent with memory.  \n",
    "- Or use your gained insights to get into building custom AI assistants with [LibreChat](https://www.librechat.ai/docs/features/agents).\n",
